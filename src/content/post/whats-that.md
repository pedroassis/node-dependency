title: What's node-dependency?

It's a Dependency Injection Framework for NodeJS.  
It discovers your files and declare them to be injected and to have it's dependencies injected.  

> No hard to write configuration files

##### Dependency Injection made easy

I've heard that NodeJS is based in somethin' called `Module Pattern`, where you expose a module, which can be a Function, a Object or whatever.  

Then you can `require` then by name and use it as needed.  

If you are (hopefully) starting a new NodeJS project, I highly recommend you to think in what kind of structure and what patterns you are going to use and most of all: **Stick with them**.  

> **node-dependency** helps you choose a well known pattern

If you choose to use node-dependency you'll have to follow some guidelines, therefore having a uniform code.  

Benefits:  
- Code easy to read and write  
- Uniform structure  
- Truly Object Oriented  
- Easy to pick-up  
- No strange patterns defined by the language community
